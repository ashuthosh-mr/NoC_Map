# NoC_MAP
This repository contains a code to generate heatmap based on the topology of the network and number of nodes in the network. Heatmap corresponds to the minimum number of hops between source and destination nodes in the chosen topology. Supported topologies: 1D, 1D Torus, 2D mesh, 2D mesh torus. Bidirectional channel between the nodes is assumed.
